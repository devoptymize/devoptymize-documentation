### To change Git url link in forked repos manually

In the newly forked Child "DevOptymize_Jenkins_Shared_Libraries" repository, below are the files in which we got to update URLs of the new blank git repos  ( that we created as part of [Step 1](../README.md/#new-repo) )
 
- /vars/tf_scm_checkout.groovy
- /vars/cft_scm_checkout.groovy
- /jobs/resource_multibranch.groovy
- /jobs/config_multibranch.groovy
